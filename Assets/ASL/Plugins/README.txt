Plugins were generated by following the directions here:
https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/getting-started/ (download the Realtime Client SDK)

The dlls that are generated from this realtime client sdk have been imported into ASL for you. Except for Google.Proto.dll. This is because GoogleARCore SDK already has its own version and Unity throws errors when the two exist. Therefore, if you remove GoogleARCore from your project because you aren't using it, you will also need to create (build) and import the Google.Proto.dll file from the download link above it.
